## 🧠 About

RecipeViewer is a lightweight front-end application that lets users **search for recipes** and view recipe details in a clean UI. It's ideal for practicing API usage, DOM rendering, and responsive front-end design.

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## 💡 How It Works

1. User types a search term in the input field.
2. JavaScript handles the input and fetches recipe data (from an API or local JSON).
3. Recipes are displayed dynamically on the page.

👉 You can easily connect this to the **DummyJSON recipes API** (`https://dummyjson.com/recipes`) if you want real recipe data. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
